# Personal site

This is my personal site, available at [https://thomashansen.xyz](https://thomashansen.xyz) which contains a variety of blog articles and past personal projects. Uses a simple go server and functions as a static site running from a sibyl node.

## Personal Note

Certification can be renewed after **shutting down** the file server and running

```
$ certbot renew
```
